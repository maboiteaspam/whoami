# whoami

Hi there, it s 2015-12-21.

On the internet i call myself `maboiteaspam`, i m thirty years old software developer.

At some point i did not feel satisfied by the language i used, then i discovered node.

I got virus about node, and it s bad, real bad.

I practice it a lot, and love it a lot !

More than a language, node empowers its user, and that s amazing.

I don t like much to speak about me, I invite you to make your own `whoami` and try it with `whoareyou` if it s the kind of activity that please you.

I also really want to share about those users as they are valuable members of the node community,

isaacs, mafintosh, rvagg, feross, maxogden, substack, feross, mscdex and sure lot more valuable people out there,
it s just i spent quit few time to dig into their repo specifically.

# whoareyou

`whoareyou` is command line utility written in javascript to query user `whoami` on github.

you can find it on `github` or `npm` at your convenience.
